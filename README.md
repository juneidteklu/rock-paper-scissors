# rock-paper-scissors

## The current version of this program allows you to play one round of rock-paper-scissors, displaying if you won, lost, or if it was a draw. The winner of that round gets one point added to their scoreboard. 


I have been learning web developemnt through the Odin Project for the past year and this is my first JavaScript program! The learning objectives for this project is to deepen my knowledge on functions and applying everything that I have learned so far about variables, operators, conditionals, and most importantly: problem solving. This is how my program works:

*My program asks you to input rock, paper, or scissors and formats it so that only the first letter is capitalized
*Uses a function to randomly choose 0,1, or 2 and uses a switch statement to return rock, paper, or scissors depending on the chosen random number
*Another funciton checks the users and the computers choice and determines a winner. Displays whether you won, lost, or if it was a draw
*The final function checks if "You won" or "You lost" was displayed and adds a point to the winners scoreboard
